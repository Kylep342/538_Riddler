## Problem

From David Nusbaum, a paradoxical navigational puzzle:

Describe where on Earth from which you can travel one mile south, then one mile east and then one mile north and arrive at your original location.

Hint: There is more than one such location.


## Solution

There are infinitely many locations, but they can be expressed as a member of one of two groups:
1. The North Pole
2. Any point along a line of latitude one mile north of another line of latitude which belongs to a special group of lines of latitude the Southern Hemisphere.

## Explanations
### The North Pole

When on the North Pole, no matter which way you face, you can only go south. After going south, you then proceed one mile east. Since going east has no effect on your position relative to the directions of north and south, you remain one mile south from the North Pole the entire time you are walking east. After walking one mile east, you then go one mile north, which is the exact distance you must cover to reach the North Pole, which was the starting point.

### Any point on a special line of latitude one mile north of one of the special lines of latitude in the Southern Hemisphere.

What a title! Anyway, consider the line of latitude in the Southern Hemisphere that is one mile north of the line of latitude which measures one mile long. Why one mile long? Well, if you travel one mile south to this latitude, one mile east along it, and then one mile north, you will always end up where you started. This is because traveling one mile east (or west) along this latitude is equivalent to not moving at all! Think of it like a lap on a one mile racetrack. If you travel exactly one mile, you may have covered one lap's worth of distance, but you have not displaced yourself at all. Essentially, relative to any observer, your position hasn't changed. This is how [displacement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Displacement_(vector)) works and why we need to start one mile north of this latitude.

This explanation is cool, and possibly mind-boggling, but we aren't done. We ***aren't even close to done!*** In fact, there are ***infinitely many*** of these circles on the Earth.

To understand this better, let's go back to the racetrack analogy. On a one mile track, going around one mile (one lap) gives you a distance of one mile traveled, but a displacement of zero, since laps start and end in the same spot. However, a one mile track is not the only track where you could travel one mile and end up where you started. Consider a 1/*n* mile track, where *n* is a positive integer. On this track, traveling one mile is equivalent to traveling *exactly n* laps. In other words, on any of these tracks, you will end up where you start if you travel one mile. Again, all we have to do is find the line of latitude in the Southern Hemisphere which is one mile north of this 1/*n* mile long line of latitude, and we have another set of infinitely many solutions. Since there are infinitely many positive integers, there are infinitely many lines of latitude which produce this effect when walked along, and thus there are infinitely many lines of latitude which lie one mile north of these special lines of latitude.

Warning, if you want to test this out, you have to on or near a pole, so be sure to bring a jacket.
