Riddler Express - December 7, 2018

From Josh Vandenham, precipitation permutations:

Louie walks to and from work every day. In his city, there is a 50
percent chance of rain each morning and an independent 40 percent
chance each evening. His habit is to bring (and use) an umbrella if
itâ€™s raining when he leaves the house or office, but to leave them all
behind if not. Louie owns three umbrellas.

On Sunday night, two are with him at home and one is at his office.
Assuming it never starts raining during his walk to his home or office,
what is the probability that he makes it through the work week without
getting wet?
